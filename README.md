# How to run the project

To run the project locally, all you need to do is clone it and then run 'npm start'. If a browser tab doesn't open automaticall, just go to 'localhost:3000' and you should be able to see the app.

# Notes

* I started the app with create-react-app and added the following: typescript and react-router
* Each page has its own folder with index/style/test files, which are imported by the App.tsx file.
* Functional components allow us to extract the most from hooks and other es6+ features of JS.
* There are plenty of improvements to be made but i kept it simple for the most part. A few examples that we can discuss: 

1) isolate the strings and import them on the files, 
2) using a css preprocessor, 
3) global state management if we were to build something bigger, 
4) responsive design for a set of different screen resolutions,
among some others. :)
